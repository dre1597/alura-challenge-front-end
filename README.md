# Alura challenge front-end

## About

This is my version of a project from [Alura](https://www.alura.com.br) based on [Challenge Based Learning](https://www.challengebasedlearning.org/about/) from Apple.

Week 1: First, it's HTML/CSS time. We have some cards with tasks on [Trello](https://trello.com), a base layout on [Figma](https://www.figma.com) and a community on discord to discuss about the challenge.

Week 2: Now is time to add functionality to the project with JavaScript. Again we have some tasks on [Trello](https://trello.com). On the code editor we will use [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org) to make the highlight of the code and maybe some themes.

Week 3: Coming up.

Week 4: Coming up.
